## To Contribute
The main branch is protected, so in order to contribute you need to check out to a new branch and then submit a pull request. After 1 person on the team has reviewed your code, you can go ahead and merge.

We are using yarn for both the frontend and the backend. In order to install dependencies, simply run the command `yarn install`.
