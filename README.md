## Contribution Workflow

Want to make a change? Great! Here are the steps:

1. Either make a new branch or a fork of this repository. `main` is a protected branch, **so you cannot push to it**.
2. Follow the instructions in "Development Setup" above. If you're on a fork, replace the URL with the fork's URL; if you're on a different branch, check it out using `git checkout`.
3. Make your changes!
4. **Before you push**, make sure your app builds properly. Don't be the guy who broke the entire project!
5. Once you're ready, stage and commit your changes.
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/rickroll35L/babble/pulls) with your changes, and let someone on the dev team know. 
7. If your code passes code review, we'll merge it into `main`. Congratulations! If you'd like, it's now safe to delete your branch/fork.
